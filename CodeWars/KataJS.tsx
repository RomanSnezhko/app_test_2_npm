/*
8 kyu Plural

Description:

We need a simple function that determines if a plural is needed or not. It should take a number, and return true if a plural should be used with that number or false if not. This would be useful when printing out a string such as 5 minutes, 14 apples, or 1 sun.

You only need to worry about english grammar rules for this kata, where anything that isn't singular (one of something), it is plural (not one of something).

All values will be positive integers or floats, or zero.

Solution:
*/
function plural(n) {
    return n !== 1;

/*
8 kyu Pole Vault Starting Marks

Description:

For a pole vaulter, it is very important to begin the approach run at the best possible starting mark. This is affected by numerous factors and requires fine-tuning in practice. But there is a guideline that will help a beginning vaulter start at approximately the right location for the so-called "three-step approach," based on the vaulter's body height.

This guideline was taught to me in feet and inches, but due to the international nature of Codewars, I am creating this kata to use metric units instead.

You are given the following two guidelines to begin with: (1) A vaulter with a height of 1.52 meters should start at 9.45 meters on the runway. (2) A vaulter with a height of 1.83 meters should start at 10.67 meters on the runway.

You will receive a vaulter's height in meters (which will always lie in a range between a minimum of 1.22 meters and a maximum of 2.13 meters). Your job is to return the best starting mark in meters, rounded to two decimal places.

Hint: Based on the two guidelines given above, you will want to account for the change in starting mark per change in body height. This involves a linear relationship. (If you're not clear on that, search online for "linear equation.") But there is also a constant offset involved. If you can determine the rate of change described above, you should be able to determine that constant offset.

Solution:
*/

function startingMark(bodyHeight){
    // Remember: Body height of 1.52 m --> starting mark: 9.45 m
    //           Body height of 1.83 m --> starting mark: 10.67 m
    // All other starting marks are based on these guidelines!

    var m = (10.67 - 9.45) / (1.83 - 1.52);
    return Math.round((10.67 + m * bodyHeight - m * 1.83) * 100) / 100;

/*
7 kyu Categorize New Member

Description:

The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

Input

Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

Output

Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

Example

input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

7 kyu Triangular Treasure

Description:

riangular numbers are so called because of the equilateral triangular shape that they occupy when laid out as dots. i.e.

You need to return the nth triangular number. You should return 0 for out of range values:

For example: (Input --> Output)

0 --> 0
2 --> 3
3 --> 6
-10 --> 0

Polly is 8 years old. She is eagerly awaiting Christmas as she has a bone to pick with Santa Claus. Last year she asked for a horse, and he brought her a dolls house. Understandably she is livid.

The days seem to drag and drag so Polly asks her friend to help her keep count of how long it is until Christmas, in days. She will start counting from the first of December.

Watch out for leap years!
